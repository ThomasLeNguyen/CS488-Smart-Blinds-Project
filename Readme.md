# CS488 Final Project Repo

## Project Description

This project is for the final project that enables the automation of smart shades using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, a stepper motor and driver, and uses various provided Arduino libraries.
Using the ArduinoBLE, Arduino_ADPS9960, Arduino_LPS22HB, and Stepper libraries, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is able to read the light intensity, and temperature to determine whether to close or open the shades.
The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense can interact with bluetooth devices using the ArduinoBLE library to manually open or close the shades.
